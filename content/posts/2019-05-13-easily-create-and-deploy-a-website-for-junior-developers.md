## Who this is for?
Mostly anyone who wants to get a simple and cheap website out and into the world quickly.

However, it's best suited to those just dipping their feet into web development and those who've newly taken the plunge.

## What skills do I need?
Basic HTML and CSS skills. For example: if you've created one to a few tiny web pages with these two you should be good to go!

** Bonus Skills **

* `git`
* JavaScript for a fancier site


## How much will this cost?
Hosting is free!

However, if you want your own special domain, such as "dis-mah-website.com", this is usually as cheap as $12. It can also be as expensive as $50 million if you're going for something ultra-popular. Alternatively, if you're cool with having something like "dis-mah-website.*netlify*.com", then no $$$ required! The web is super cool these days.

## Step by step
